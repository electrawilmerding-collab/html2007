                    <p>The internet is an integral part of our daily lives. Over time, its accessibility has developed in a way that benefits those who may profit from it or have the means to meaningfully work with it. Simple computer science concepts, that we all deserve to understand or engage with if we so desire, have become overcomplicated and convoluted. This website is an attempt to resist these algorithmic-driven changes and bring back creativity and intentionality within technology. In other words, ‘Re-weirding,’ the internet. 
In my freshman year of high school, I had an assignment to create an HTML website from scratch and personalize it to explore any topic of my choice based on the information I learned throughout the course of Introduction to Computer Science. I had so much fun utilizing CodeHS to personalize my website–I created a platform to write about my favorite musicians and rank my favorite albums, with an additional section that featured pictures taken at a few concerts I attended that year. The coding process was undeniably difficult and time-consuming, but extremely rewarding–even if the website was only available to myself through my CodeHS account. It felt like I finally had an inside perspective to the world I played an active role in but really knew little about.
HTML Like it’s 2007 allowed me to expand on this aspect of personalization while synthesizing the idea of remediation: the process of new media borrowing from and reinterpreting old media forms. Specifically, how reshaping forms of media changes the user’s perception of technology. Olia LiaLina’s 1996 piece, My Boyfriend Came Back From the War (https://sites.rhizome.org/anthology/lialina.html), really spoke to me because of its dated structure, plainness, and requirement of patience–three characteristics unique to the early internet. I was influenced to emulate a similar design with minimal distractions, where the user can only focus on one thing at a time. My ASCII art remains straightforward in this way, with nothing but a few customized symbols to create the image of a shooting star.
Additionally, I made these choices to push users towards an understanding of the humanity behind technology, where every website is an intentional creation.
